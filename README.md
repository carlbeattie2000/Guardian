# Guardian

Guardian is a Australian community policing application, essentially a online portal which enables reporting crimes and contacting your local force.

### Running the backend for development
- `git clone https://github.com/carlbeattie2000/Guardian.git ~/some/location/guardian`
- `cd ~/some/location/guardian/backend`
- `npm install`
- `set env variables or create .env using example-env`
- `npm run model:train`
- `npm run dev`

You can then visit `localhost:port/api-docs` and view all available endpoints
